# Smart-Resume
The Resume Generator project aims to develop an AI-driven tool for automating the creation of professional resumes. The objective is to build a generative model that can craft tailored resumes based on user inputs such as personal information, job experience, and career goals. By analyzing these details, the model produces well-structured resumes that effectively highlight the candidateâ€™s skills, achievements, and qualifications. This tool streamlines the resume creation process, enabling users to generate polished and personalized resumes quickly, thereby enhancing their ability to present themselves effectively to potential employers and improve their job application success.
